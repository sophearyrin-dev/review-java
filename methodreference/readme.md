# Method Reference
- method reference is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression that executes a method. It allows you to directly refer to methods or constructors without having to invoke them explicitly. This is part of the syntax introduced in Java 8 for functional programming and can make the code more readable and concise.

- Hereâ€™s how method references can simplify the code compared to lambda expressions:

```java
// Using Lambda Expression
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Paul");
names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));

// Using Method Reference
names.forEach(System.out::println);
```

- The parameter types can be omitted. When only one parameter is specified witohuut a type , the pareenthese can also be omited. The braces and return statement can be omitted for a single statement, making the short form as follows: a -> a.equals(b);
