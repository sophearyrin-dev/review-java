- we use stream to perform operation on collections like filtering, mapping, reducing, ..
- Stream pipe line consist of 2 parts:
    - Intermediate operations: 
        - filter(): Filters elements based on a condition.
        - map(): Transforms elements.
        - sorted(): Sorts elements.
        - distinct(): Removes duplicates.
    - Terminal operation:
        - collect(): Gathers elements into a collection.
        - forEach(): Applies an action to each element.
        - reduce(): Aggregates elements to produce a single value (e.g., sum, product).
        - count(): Counts the number of elements in the stream.
